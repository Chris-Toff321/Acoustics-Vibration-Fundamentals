# Acoustics-Vibration-Fundamentals


Engineering-oriented fundamentals of acoustics and vibration, focused on **physical intuition, practical interpretation, and real-world NVH work**.

This repository explains what actually matters in engineering practice — not just formulas or idealized models.

---

## Why this repo

In real NVH work, structures are coupled, measurements are imperfect, and simple indicators often mislead.
This repo focuses on:
- Physical meaning behind key concepts  
- Engineering intuition over mathematical completeness  
- Common misconceptions seen in practice  

If a concept cannot help interpret data or guide decisions, it does not belong here.
